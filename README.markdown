# British Umlauts #

The pragmatic OS X keyboard layout for developers or Adobe Creative Suite users who (also) type in German. If this combination does not apply to you, you are probably not interested.

## Why? ##

German keyboard layouts are painful to use in software development, where special characters like brackets, braces, slashes are frequently needed but difficult to access. Applications like Photoshop commonly use these characters as useful keyboard shortcuts.

On the other hand, the default British keyboard layout makes it difficult to type in German. While the _ß_ character is accessible using `⌥S`, the Umlaut characters can only be reached via the `⌥U` dead key. For instance, you need to type `⌥U` then `⇧⌥A` to get _Ä_.


## How? ##

British Umlauts is based on the default British keyboard layout but provides to direct access to Umlaut characters:

- `⌥A` = _ä_
- `⌥O` = _ö_
- `⌥U` = _ü_
- `⇧⌥A` = _Ä_
- `⇧⌥O` = _Ö_
- `⇧⌥U` = _Ü_
- `⌥S` = _ß_ (unchanged from British layout)

The layout provides all the convenience of an English keyboard layout yet allows typing German at near-native speed, as the use of modifier keys is much faster than dead-key access.

The Umlaut dead-key state is still available but remapped to `^⌥U`. This allows continued access to other characters that use the same diacritic, e.g. _ë_.
