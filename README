OS X keyboard layout for developers and users of Creative Suite who occasionally type in German.

Doesn't apply to you? You're probably not interested in this.

It's based on the default British keyboard layout but provides direct access to umlauts:
 - ⌥A = ä
 - ⌥O = ö
 - ⌥U = ü
 - ⇧⌥A = Ä
 - ⇧⌥O = Ö
 - ⇧⌥U = Ü
